Introduction to Object oriented programming :
 * Procedural language there some flaws so we came to object oriented program
 * It is more secure to the data
 * It allows more number of entities is called object
	Example : class		object
		  Animal	Dog,cows,.....
 * If we write the data in one function if can not allow to another function directly,
 if we create a object of function then the data will be transfer
 * New data and functions can be easily added when it is necessary
 * It is bottom up approach program
 * Principles :
	*Object
	*Classes
	*Data abstraction and encapsulation
	*Inheritance
	*Polymorphism
